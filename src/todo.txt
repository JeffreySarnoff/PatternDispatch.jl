 * Improve show_dispatch output
   - Nicer names for unnamed temporaries
 * Emit dispatch methods in reverse topological order
 * Extract preparations from first predicate in code_predicate
   - reflect in results
 * Raise errors on unimplemented features:
   - non-tree patterns
   - type parameters
   - varargs
 * Pull computations upward in decision tree as far as they are needed
   by every branch
 * Eliminate sure branches
 * Remove line numbers from dispatch code
