 * Represent the body of a method with a function
 * Reinstatiate ambiguity warnings
 * Introduce heuristic for pivot selection decision tree
 * Add Array pattern
 * Add switch syntax
 Possible syntax:

    @match expression begin
        (x::Int)->print(x)
        1->print("one")
        x->print("Not an Int")
    end

This should probably create a decision tree directly, without using cooperative dispatch?
